					<description><![CDATA[A Single Point of Failure (SPOF) is a device, system, or process that, when broken, impacts numerous downstream systems. In general terms, it is the thing that if it fails, everything comes to a halt. Generally, it is impossible to remove a SPOF, but unwittingly, we often have a common SPOF that will impact multiple [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As part my responsibilities with governance of IT and Technology, I need to be able to validate certain things that team members, and contractors say. Recently, I had a solo developer inform me that they develop their software securely, but they do not follow and have not implemented any Secure Software Development Lifecycles.

					<description><![CDATA[What separates out a long-term successful IT project, is how the implicit, or implied requirements are understood and met. This can be from the levels of security that are expected such as MFA being a feature of the platform, through to nuanced things such as the names of buttons and actions within the system.

					<description><![CDATA[One saying that many of my colleagues and clients hear me mutter is: Assumptions and Constraints. During my early days at university (and in high school maths), we were taught to list out the assumptions we were making. These assumptions helped define the problem and how we were going to solve it. They also created [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Checklist Risk Management is the practice of using a pre-defined checklist, that is produced in bulk, has little customisation, and pushed to your organisation by a vendor, stakeholders, or customer. It is typical that these come in the form of a self-answered audit that have questions such as: These audits tend to demand binary responses [&#8230;]]]></description>

The simple question is, what is corporate governance in how it relates to IT and technology?

But the question that is frequently asked raised is, Why bother with secure software development? A lot of that question is loaded in the myths that surround software development such as: Secure Software Development Lifecycle [&#8230;]]]></description>

Formal or defined SDLs are nothing new, they have been around in one form or another since the 1970&#8217;s. If you are a user of software, you probably have some understanding of the aspects that make software high-quality. [&#8230;]]]></description>

Specifically, the long-term issues with the solution. However, its abstract nature often leaves non-technical stakeholders grappling with its implications for decision-making.
