					<description><![CDATA[One saying that many of my colleagues and clients hear me mutter is: Assumptions and Constraints. During my early days at university (and in high school maths), we were taught to list out the assumptions we were making. These assumptions helped define the problem and how we were going to solve it. They also created [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Checklist Risk Management is the practice of using a pre-defined checklist, that is produced in bulk, has little customisation, and pushed to your organisation by a vendor, stakeholders, or customer. It is typical that these come in the form of a self-answered audit that have questions such as: These audits tend to demand binary responses [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Corporate Governance and IT (with extension with technology) is a sprawling area, with more and more requirements from legislation, stakeholders, customers and consumers. The simple question is, what is corporate governance in how it relates to IT and technology? Corporate Governance in relation to IT (and technology), is the method(s) and processes that a person, [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Secure software development life cycle is simply the set of processes that aid to build software that is more secure. But the question that is frequently asked raised is, Why bother with secure software development? A lot of that question is loaded in the myths that surround software development such as: Secure Software Development Lifecycle [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Software Development Lifecycle (SDL) is the set of processes that aid in the creation of high-quality software. Formal or defined SDLs are nothing new, they have been around in one form or another since the 1970&#8217;s. If you are a user of software, you probably have some understanding of the aspects that make software high-quality. [&#8230;]]]></description>

It is not a magical skill set, and can be self-taught with little more than an internet connection and the desire to solve problems.

Specifically, the long-term issues with the solution. However, its abstract nature often leaves non-technical stakeholders grappling with its implications for decision-making. Drawing parallels with a financial loan, the concept of Technical Debt suggests that every [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interfaces are how I look at and design systems. The interfaces that I attempt to create come in two varieties, fix and rigid, or soft and flexible. Sometimes these are the abstractions in virtual environments such as software, or physical definitions that are more tangible such as a bolt pattern to hold a PCB board [&#8230;]]]></description>

These include the location and method of data storage, the metadata associated with it, data querying, access authorization, cost optimization, data auditing, and more.
