					<description><![CDATA[In the depths of an underground mine, I piloted a drone through the dimly lit tunnels. Suddenly, it crashed into a wall, and the propellers shattered, sending shards flying in all directions. One of the largest shards, a jagged piece of carbon fibre and plastic, would then hang on my wall as a stark reminder [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What separates out a long-term successful IT project, is how the implicit, or implied requirements are understood and met. This can be from the levels of security that are expected such as MFA being a feature of the platform, through to nuanced things such as the names of buttons and actions within the system.

					<description><![CDATA[One saying that many of my colleagues and clients hear me mutter is: Assumptions and Constraints. During my early days at university (and in high school maths), we were taught to list out the assumptions we were making. These assumptions helped define the problem and how we were going to solve it. They also created [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Risk management is an overlooked aspect of IT and generally in the broader technology landscape, frequently it is conducted under a facade of &#8220;checklist risk management&#8220;. However, with the rise of security and privacy being top of mind, the risk management needs to be a conscious activity done throughout the IT lifecycle.

					<description><![CDATA[Checklist Risk Management is the practice of using a pre-defined checklist, that is produced in bulk, has little customisation, and pushed to your organisation by a vendor, stakeholders, or customer. It is typical that these come in the form of a self-answered audit that have questions such as: These audits tend to demand binary responses [&#8230;]]]></description>

The simple question is, what is corporate governance in how it relates to IT and technology?

Formal or defined SDLs are nothing new, they have been around in one form or another since the 1970&#8217;s.
