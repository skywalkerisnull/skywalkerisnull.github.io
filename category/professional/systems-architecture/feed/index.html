					<description><![CDATA[A Single Point of Failure (SPOF) is a device, system, or process that, when broken, impacts numerous downstream systems. In general terms, it is the thing that if it fails, everything comes to a halt. Generally, it is impossible to remove a SPOF, but unwittingly, we often have a common SPOF that will impact multiple [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As part my responsibilities with governance of IT and Technology, I need to be able to validate certain things that team members, and contractors say. Recently, I had a solo developer inform me that they develop their software securely, but they do not follow and have not implemented any Secure Software Development Lifecycles. And that [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What separates out a long-term successful IT project, is how the implicit, or implied requirements are understood and met. This can be from the levels of security that are expected such as MFA being a feature of the platform, through to nuanced things such as the names of buttons and actions within the system.

					<description><![CDATA[One saying that many of my colleagues and clients hear me mutter is: Assumptions and Constraints. During my early days at university (and in high school maths), we were taught to list out the assumptions we were making. These assumptions helped define the problem and how we were going to solve it. They also created [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Secure software development life cycle is simply the set of processes that aid to build software that is more secure. But the question that is frequently asked raised is, Why bother with secure software development? A lot of that question is loaded in the myths that surround software development such as: Secure Software Development Lifecycle [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Software Development Lifecycle (SDL) is the set of processes that aid in the creation of high-quality software. Formal or defined SDLs are nothing new, they have been around in one form or another since the 1970&#8217;s. If you are a user of software, you probably have some understanding of the aspects that make software high-quality. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The concept of Technical Debt concept was designed to try and communicate to non-technical stakeholders the issues with the solution. Specifically, the long-term issues with the solution. However, its abstract nature often leaves non-technical stakeholders grappling with its implications for decision-making. Drawing parallels with a financial loan, the concept of Technical Debt suggests that every [&#8230;]]]></description>

Sometimes these are the abstractions in virtual environments such as software, or physical definitions that are more tangible such as a bolt pattern to hold a PCB board [&#8230;]]]></description>

These include the location and method of data storage, the metadata associated with it, data querying, access authorization, cost optimization, data auditing, and more.
