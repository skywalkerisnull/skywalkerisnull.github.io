					<description><![CDATA[I was recently asked what the back story of my user handle, #SkywalkerIsNull is? And as we all know, naming things is hard. I have been on the internet for a while now, and my previous online identities were most created when I was a pre-teen, or teenager. At the time they were cool, but [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As part my responsibilities with governance of IT and Technology, I need to be able to validate certain things that team members, and contractors say. Recently, I had a solo developer inform me that they develop their software securely, but they do not follow and have not implemented any Secure Software Development Lifecycles.

					<description><![CDATA[What separates out a long-term successful IT project, is how the implicit, or implied requirements are understood and met. This can be from the levels of security that are expected such as MFA being a feature of the platform, through to nuanced things such as the names of buttons and actions within the system.

					<description><![CDATA[One saying that many of my colleagues and clients hear me mutter is: Assumptions and Constraints. During my early days at university (and in high school maths), we were taught to list out the assumptions we were making.
