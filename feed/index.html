					<description><![CDATA[On a recent road trip from Toowoomba (QLD) to Gunnedah (NSW) for a wedding, our return drive went through Tamworth and Armidale. On the north side of Tamworth we took a quick detour to stretch our legs at the Moonbi Lookout and took in the view over the valley. Behind the monolithic lookout was a [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The skills required for the creation of software is one that anyone can gain. Literally, you, your parents, your friends, your children, anyone can learn. It is not a magical skill set, and can be self-taught with little more than an internet connection and the desire to solve problems.

					<description><![CDATA[The concept of Technical Debt concept was designed to try and communicate to non-technical stakeholders the issues with the solution. Specifically, the long-term issues with the solution. However, its abstract nature often leaves non-technical stakeholders grappling with its implications for decision-making. Drawing parallels with a financial loan, the concept of Technical Debt suggests that every [&#8230;]]]></description>
